## Part 2

For this part of the exam you should comment on one of the activities you have done with your group for your group project. It's important that this activity you've completed is in it's own branch and you send the link to the branch when you submit for grading. 

### For the passing grade

+ Explain what exactly your product backlog item entails and how your workflow looks like

+ Develop your chosen backlog item with good code structure. What you chose to develop is up to you and depends on what your activity is about. Maybe it's only frontend and graphic or maybe it's only backend or both. 

+ Have an agile workflow. There should be multiple git commits on your branch on GitHub.

### For the good grade

+ Have at least one unit test

+ Write down a revision of your time estimation for this activity. How long did you think this activity would take and how long did it take you? What happened?
